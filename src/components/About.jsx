        <p>
          My name is William Lee and I have a background in engineering. About a year ago, I found myself unsatisfied about where I am going in life and felt like I wasn't being challenged enough so I picked up Computer Science despite already having a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I was working full time as a Project Engineer in a construction company and also studying CS on my free time. I found CS to be highly engaging and fulfilling because of the challenges and diversity of both the problems and the people that I have met in this field.

          So far, I've been able to get proficient with HTML, CSS, and JS. From there, a contact from my network suggested I get familiar with React for its popularity so I started to make several projects with it to make sure I understood the 'laws' of React and how to think in terms of React. Using that knowledge I made a couple of projects utilising React and REST APIs which you can find a link to, in the Projects section. I have also tried other frameworks like jQuery and dabbled in SASS and Bootstrap.  I use GitHub for all my projects, you can find a link to me in the contact section.

          Currently, I am looking to be able to work using React.js as it is the framework that I am very interested to expand on. My future plans are to take on new frameworks like Angular and also to move on to backend development eventually. Programming is a subject that is continuously growing and changing with time; and I would love to grow and change with it. I am passionate about what I am creating and also the process of learning new skills everyday.
